    <h2>Main Page</h2>

    <p>Once you login, you'll have a mostly empty screen, with drop-downs to Select Supervisor, Year, and Quarter.</p>
    <img src="/cc/rank_rate_inc/images/rr_index.png" alt="Index">

    <h3 id="selectSup">Selecting Supervisor, Quarter, and Year</h3>
    <p>To begin, select your desired supervisor, year, and quarter. Legacy users will note that there is no longer a submit button -
        the app is constantly checking for inputs, and updates the displayed employees based on the inputs given.</p>
    <img src="/cc/rank_rate_inc/images/rr_employees.png" alt="Employee Listing">

    <h3 id="shiftRank">Shift Ranking</h3>
    <p>Shift Ranking adjustment is accomplished by a modal that allows you to drag people. Drag your employees to their desired
        relative position, and the numbering will auto-adjust. Note that if you have both EQP and PRC, it's preferred to separately rank them.
    </p>
    <img src="/cc/rank_rate_inc/images/rr_shift_rank.png" alt="Shift Ranking">

    <h3 id="bulkAdd">Bulk Add</h3>
    <p>Bulk Add allows you to add a blank template for your entire shift. You'll need to use this to create a new Quarter to edit.
        Note that it simply copies the last quarter's employees, so if you had a transfer, manual edits will need to take place.
        To use this, select the desired Quarter and Year, and click 'Submit Changes.'
    </p>
    <img src="/cc/rank_rate_inc/images/rr_bulk_add.png" alt="Bulk Add">

    <h2>Individual Records</h2>

    <h3 id="readUpdate">Read/Update</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Read/Update allows you to edit an individual's quarterly entry.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The grayed-out boxes show you information about the employee; some of it as a verification that you're editing the right person,
                and others that are useful to know such as their running average for the year.
            </li>
            <li>There are nine checkboxes to the right, which you can choose from. There are no limits to what you can select,
                so be reasonable - if the employee has an EAN entry, they may not necessarily be on a negative
                watch, but they probably aren't on a positive watch.
            </li>
            <li>The Overall Rating drop-down can be used to manually override a rating, but it should be populated via the MBO Calc modal.
            </li>
            <li>Submit/Back/Delete are self-explanatory. Note that Submit is only needed for manually selecting a rating, or checkboxes. All
                modals have their own submittals. Delete will give you one warning allowing you to cancel, but once done, the rating is lost.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <img src="/cc/rank_rate_inc/images/rr_read_update.png" alt="Read/Update">

    <h3 id="blueBook">Blue Book</h3>
    <p>Blue Book opens a modal with a predefined template based on current MBOs for the group. You are free to write whatever
    supporting information you would like in here, but you're encouraged to keep the template format, and add free-form at the bottom. Note
    that spell check is provided free of charge. You are encouraged to take its suggestions.</p>
    <img src="/cc/rank_rate_inc/images/rr_bluebook.png" alt="Blue Book">

    <h3 id="mboCalc">MBO Calculator</h3>
    <p>MBO Calc opens a double modal that calculates an employee's numeric and alphabetic rating, based on MBOs. Each category can have
        one item selected - to deselect an item, click it again, and notice that the highlighting disappears. As you move through the
        categories, the score to the right will change to reflect your inputs. When submitted, the entry for this specific Quarter/Year
        becomes part of the Running Average seen on the main Read/Update page. Note that the Current Quarter Rating modal is attached to the
        MBO Calculator modal; by closing the main modal, the secondary modal will close.
    </p>
    <img src="/cc/rank_rate_inc/images/rr_mbo_calc.png" alt="MBO Calculator">

    <h3 id="reassign">Reassign</h3>
    <p>Reassign opens a modal that allows you to reassign an individual to another supervisor, or the entire shift. This is useful for intra-team
        transfers (for the former) or if a supervisor leaves (for the latter). Note that only the currently selected quarter/year will be transferred,
        thus allowing you to accurately view historical information as it was for the time.
    </p>
    <img src="/cc/rank_rate_inc/images/rr_reassign.png" alt="Reassign">

    <h3 id="shiftSummary">Summarize</h3>
    <p>You can summarize either your shift, or all shifts. This will open up an interactive grid, much like an Excel Pivot Table, which allows
        you to view all data for your shift. You can filter items by any column you'd like by entering some or all of the desired filter at the top, e.g.
        '2' in 'Quarter' will display all 2nd Quarter entries, 'Eng' in 'Title' will display all levels of Engineer (since 'Eng' is not a substring of
        any level of Technician). Note that for the boolean values, i.e. checkboxes, you'll need to use 'T' and 'F' to filter them.
    </p>
    <p>Double-clicking on any item other than an employee's name will allow you to edit it, but note that this does not change the stored data. It's
        useful for performing what-if scenarios for the chart (next section), however. Double-clicking on an employee's name brings up the specific writeup
        for that quarter/year.
    </p>
    <p>Right-clicking anywhere on the table allows you export the table to convenient formats such as CSV and XLSX, for sharing with others.
    </p>
    <img src="/cc/rank_rate_inc/images/rr_summarize_table.png" alt="Summarize Shift">

    <h3 id="shiftChart">Chart</h3>
    <p>If you scroll to the bottom of the table, you'll see the chart of Expected vs. Actual for the four Ratings. Hovering over the Unsuccessful
    and Exceeds Most categories gives you a pop-up tag of names with those ratings, to aid in quick identification of those that may need a second look.</p>
